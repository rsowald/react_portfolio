  ## Description

  [Deployed Application](https://rsowald.github.io/react_portfolio/)
   
   This is my professional portfolio built with React. It features several of the applications I created over the course of coding boot camp. It uses a React router and switch to change the page content in response to user interaction without loading new pages.
